This website aims to be a handbook that can help national and local labs to
build capacity and competence on the use of NGS methods for surveillance
purposes. This work was started as part of the `"One health surRveillance
Initiative On harmonization of data collection and interpretatioN
(ORION)" <https://onehealthejp.eu/jip-orion/>`__ One Health EJP project.

The ORION project, launched in 2018, aims at establishing and strengthening
inter-institutional collaboration and transdisciplinary knowledge transfer in
the area of surveillance data integration and interpretation, along the One
Health (OH) objective of improving health and well-being.

This handbook consists of several parts, to understand more about how this
