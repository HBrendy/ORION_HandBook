The ORION sequencing for surveillance handbook
==================================================================================================
This website aims to be a handbook that can help national and local labs
to build capacity and competence on the use of NGS methods for surveillance
purposes. This work is part of the "One health surRveillance Initiative On
harmonization of data collection and interpretatioN (ORION)" One Health EJP
project.

The ORION project, launched in 2018, aims at establishing and strengthening
inter-institutional collaboration and transdisciplinary knowledge transfer in
the area of surveillance data integration and interpretation, along the One
Health (OH) objective of improving health and well-being.

Through three main work packages (WP), ORION’s specific goals can be summarized
as the delivery of three main resources:

• a “OH Surveillance Codex” (WP1) - a high level framework for harmonised,
cross-sectional description and categorisation of surveillance data covering
all surveillance phases and all knowledge types;
• a “OHS Knowledge Hub” (WP2) - a cross-domain inventory of currently available
data sources, methods / algorithms / tools, that support OH surveillance data
generation, data analysis, modelling and decision support; and
• “OHS Infrastructural Resources” (WP3) – that are practical, infrastructural
resources forming the basis for successful harmonisation and integration of
surveillance data and methods.

The work presented on these webpages stems from the WP2-NGS workpackage.
The focus for this workpackage is on NextGen analytical data, methods, analyses
and systems. The inventory generated from this work package includes best
practices for data management and handling approaches for bacterial
identification techniques. It also includes current experiences on practical
issues such as data storage and exchange capacity, data exchange platforms,
harmonised terminology, as well as the need for bioinformatics expertise.

Participants
=============
Within this workpackage, we have had participants from eight institutions. These
are:

Karin Lagesen (NVI) (WP lead), Mohammed Umaer Naseer (NIPH) (WP deputy),
Thomas Haverkamp (NVI), Jeevan Karloss (NVI), Wonhee Cha (SVA),
Olov Svartström (FOHM), Mia Torphdahl (SSI),  Eva Litrup (SSI),
Katrine Grimstrup Joensen (SSI), Lesley Larkin (PHE), Taran Skjerdal (NVI),
Tim Dallman (PHE), Eelco Franz (RIVM), Tasja Buschhardt (BfR),
Matthias Filter (BfR)
