One health surRveillance Initiative On harmonization of data collection and interpretatioN (ORION)
================================================================================================

The ORION project, launched in 2018, aims at establishing and strengthening inter-institutional collaboration and transdisciplinary knowledge transfer in the area of surveillance data integration and interpretation, along the One Health (OH) objective of improving health and well-being. 

Through three main work packages (WP), ORION’s specific goals can be summarized as the delivery of three main resources: 

• a “OH Surveillance Codex” (WP1) - a high level framework for harmonised, cross-sectional description and categorisation of surveillance data covering all surveillance phases and all knowledge types; 
• a “OHS Knowledge Hub” (WP2) - a cross-domain inventory of currently available data sources, methods / algorithms / tools, that support OH surveillance data generation, data analysis, modelling and decision support; and 
• “OHS Infrastructural Resources” (WP3) – that are practical, infrastructural resources forming the basis for successful harmonisation and integration of surveillance data and methods. 

Developed solutions will be exemplified and validated during several One Health pilots, which will support the operationalization and implementation of OH surveillance solutions on a national level and provide crucial feedback for future development and dissemination actions. 

Trainings and workshops will be offered (WP4) to support and integrate with other EJP projects in their data harmonisation efforts.

WP summary:
The goal for this project is to create an OH Knowledge Base - a cross-domain inventory of currently available resources for performing integrated OH surveillance generation, data analysis and interpretation. The focus for the WP2NGS work package is on NextGen analytical data, methods, analyses and systems. The inventory generated from this work package will include best practices for data management and handling approaches for bacterial identification techniques. It should also include current experiences on practical issues such as data storage and exchange capacity, data exchange platforms, harmonised terminology, as well as the need for bioinformatics expertise. 
To better organize the work in this work package, we have further divided it into four focus areas, illustrated in Figure 1 below. This will also form the framework for the inventory.
