# EFSA and ECDC

Both EFSA and ECDC have done extensive work on how to implement whole genome
sequencing for surveillance and outbreak purposes. This page is meant to
collect reports and opinions from these institutions.  

These institutions also have reports that specifically advice on specific
pathogens, information on these are found in the species specific sections.
