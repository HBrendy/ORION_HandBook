Concept List
==========
Short definition for the echnical and practical words used in the report.


**Project based:** 
Before start uploading data for analysis, user has to start a project. Project needs a project name and some more details. Only after creating project a user can upload the data into that project and the data belongs to that project. A data can not be uploaded without any projects. Every activity on the data will be stored under that project. The use who started the project is the owner of the project. More than one user can be added to a project and their access roles (read, write or manipulate) is defined by the owner of the project. No one else outside the project can see or access the data.

**Database management:** 
A database management system (DBMS) is a software package which allows a user to store, manipulate and retrieve data in an organized way. DBMS can have more than one database. DBMS administrators can define who can read, manipulate or retrieve the data from a database (access control).

**Galaxy:** 
Galaxy is a browser based online platform designed for running Bioinformatics tools and pipelines where complex unix command line based tools can be executed in a mouse click. Galaxy is considered as one of the most users friendly online software platforms. It is an open source (original source code is made freely available and may be redistributed and modified)     

**Framework:** 
A logical structure intended to provide a comprehensive collection of tools and data management.  

**Activity log:** 
It is very important to trace the data and analysis flow back if there is a need to find an error in analysis or misuse or manipulation of data.  

**Instance:**
Individual installations of the software framework is called  instances. 

**Metadata:**
Metadata provides more information about other one or more aspects of the data. F. ex. If you have whole genome sequencing (WGS) data of a bacterial species, geographical location, date of collection, sample type (blood, skin, feces, food, etc,.) could be meta data for the WGS data. 

**Sensitive data:**
In general, personal (name, sex, age, address, etc,.) information of a patient is considered as sensitive data. In rare cases, traced outbreak to farm or an industry could be considered as sensitive data depends upon so many circumstances.
