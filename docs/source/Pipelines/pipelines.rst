In recent years next generation sequencing has matured and with that a solidification on the required methods for WGS projects 3,4 has occurred.  Nonetheless, the current practice of microbial WGS is mostly confined to the academic world, and has not yet resulted in large scale introduction of WGS in clinical settings 5,6. However, while it is clear that the technological developments in bioinformatics proceed at a rapid pace, a consensus has been formed on which steps are required to produce WGS datasets that can be used for surveillance and outbreak analysis (Figure 2). These steps involve quality control of the raw sequence data and a subsequent usage of clean data to produce an annotated genome or reference map. Such “products” can then be used to obtain typing data, which is needed for the final analysis under surveillance or outbreak scenarios.
