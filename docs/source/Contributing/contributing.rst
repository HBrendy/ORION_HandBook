How to contribute
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The easiest way to get started is to file an issue to tell us about a spelling mistake, some awkward wording, or a factual error.
If you do not have a GitHub account, you can send us comments by email. However, we will be able to respond more quickly if you 
use one of the other methods described below.
If you have a GitHub account, or are willing to create one, but do not know how to use Git, you can report problems or suggest
improvements by creating an issue. This allows us to assign the item to someone and to respond to it in a threaded discussion.
If you are comfortable with Git, and would like to add or change material, you can submit a pull request (PR). Instructions for 
doing this are included below.

What to contribute
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We are very happy to receive any and all contributions regarding the subject matter of this handbook in whichever manner you are 
able to submit them. Many different things can be contributed, you can send us an email about relevant reports, you can submit an 
issue informing about an error you found, or you can submit a pull request contributing text on a new method or a procedure. 

If you would like to contribute, and don’t know quite where to start or what to do, please check the “Handbook Roadmap” document, 
as well as the list of current issues for the repository. 

Using Github. 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you choose to contribute via GitHub, you may want to look at How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub. 
The current version of the handbook is to be found in the master branch. This branch stays static until we decide that we have a 
new release. All development happens on the ORION-Dev-Branch. If you want to contribute, we request that you work on that one.  

How to proceed:
  * Fork (i.e. copy) the project to your account
  * Go to your fork, and change the branch of the project to the current development branch (named something with dev).
  * Then add/modify the contents you want. This can be done directly in your fork on github. We use rst format, and you can find more on this reStructuredText format in this link.
  * Commit the change.
  * Send your pull request.
  * Your pull request will be merged to ORION-Dev-Branch after manual checking.
  * The admins will then rebuild the ORION-Dev-Branch, and you will get a link to see the results. 
  * ORION-Dev-Branch will be merged to master repository ORION_HandBook with the next release.
