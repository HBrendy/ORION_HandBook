# Challenges for One Health surveillance

Foodborne diseases (FBDs) represent an epidemiological scenario in which 
pathogens and humans contact through contaminated food or water. FBDs affect 
600 million people every year, representing an important burden for human health 
([WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/food-safety)). Proper 
management of FBDs requires a good understanding of the disease, a fast detection 
and a proper response 
([WHO, 2018](https://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/foodborne_disease/wgs_landscape/en/)).
Therefore, good surveillance systems able to track the circulation of pathogens and monitor 
their medically relevant features, such as the resistome or the virulome, are 
essential for disease control. Such systems could, for example, allow the early detection 
of multidrug-resistant pathogenic populations and lead to the implementation of specific 
control strategies reducing future human or even animal illness. Moreover, information 
regarding virulence potential or drug resistance may be crucial for public health decision-making 
on the allocation of resources during outbreaks.


## WGS and One Health surveillance

As described in this handbook, WGS technologies represent the most discriminatory pathogen typing 
method (thus far), thus providing the highest surveillance resolution. For example, the application 
of WGS for listeriosis surveillance has increased the number of detected outbreaks, but decreased 
the number of cases per outbreak, thus contributing to a reduction of human illness 
([PulseNet](https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/surveillance/whole-genome-sequencing.html)). A major factor 
leading to these results is WGS highest ability to identify the sources of infection. For this reason, 
an integrated system where the clinical and the food and water sectors not only surveil for the presence 
of pathogens and their characteristics, but also interchange their data is a key to the proper FBDs 
management. In this regard, WGS represents an important advance as WGS data can be easily shared and 
compared between laboratories at national and international levels. Nevertheless, WGS implementation
is challenging and many things need to be taken into consideration. In this section we do a brief
overview of the challenges raised by the WHO
([WHO 2018](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/272430/9789241513869-eng.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)).

### Organizational perspective

The existence of an integrated system for FBDs surveillance requires the implementation of different 
strategies which may be hampered at different stages. For instance, as reported by 
[WHO (2018)](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/272430/9789241513869-eng.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y), 
from an organizational perspective, public authorities need to work on the implementation of adequate
legislation and regulation that encourages the clinical and the food and water sectors to perform continuous 
FBDs surveillance and to report their results. However, to demand such a protocol, investment in proper 
surveilling infrastructures needs to be made. For example, the implementation of WGS-based surveillance 
requires a technological transition which is not affordable in many countries. Also, resources and funding 
opportunities are unequal between different sectors (Human health, Animal Health, Environmental Health and 
Food Safety).

### Scientific perspective

From a scientific perspective, WGS-based surveillance systems require multi-tasked teams with different 
scientific backgrounds for proper data analysis, including specialized microbiologists and bioinformaticians 
([WHO 2018](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/272430/9789241513869-eng.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)). 
Hence, investment (not only financial but also of time) in training highly skilled technicians to integrate 
the different teams is crucial for proper data analysis and interpretation of the results. Furthermore, there 
is a need to guarantee inter-laboratory data integration and comparability of results. For example, efforts should 
be made in the harmonization of genetic nomenclatures, because, as mentioned before in this handbook, different 
platforms use different allele nomenclatures hampering the comparison of their data. Such efforts in training human 
resources, standardizing protocols and in the harmonization of the results would definitely contribute to ease the 
comparison between different labs, sectors and even countries. In this regard, some technical aspects may also influence 
the implementation of such systems, such as the need for high computing power to handle the data, or servers where data 
can be stored and shared between partners. Good political strategies for investment have the power to overcome these 
issues. Noteworthy, data protection should always be guaranteed, and robust anonymization strategies implemented. 

### Cultural barriers

Ultimately, even if all the above-mentioned barriers for the implementation of a proper WGS-based surveillance system 
are overcome, cultural barriers may also be an issue ([WHO 2018](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/272430/9789241513869-eng.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)). Besides the language barrier in international cooperation, and 
the usual resistance to change, cross-sectoral collaboration may be difficult to implement. Actions promoting the 
concept of One Health, and showing the relevance of this integrated perspective where human, animal and environmental 
health are connected, may contribute to raise the awareness of politicians, scientists, health practitioners, and 
ultimately all the citizens and surpass some of the above-mentioned obstacles.

## Future perspectives

WGS is gradually being integrated in the surveillance system of developed countries. The possibility of connecting WGS 
data with data obtained from previous technologies allows a gradual transition, where data from the past is not lost because 
data from different technologies are still comparable with WGS. An agreement has been made that _Listeria_ would be the first 
bacterial pathogen where such a system would be implemented, and this has been progressing fast. Meanwhile, WGS is gradually 
expanding to other FBDs causative agents, such as _Salmonella_, _Escherichia_ or _Campylobacter_, but there is still a long 
way to go. This gradual technological transition is important for a proper allocation of resources and management of the different 
obstacles. In the end, it is expected that in a few years WGS-based surveillance systems are fully operational for several FBDs 
monitorization from a One Health perspective.
